        <h1>A Return to Normal For Who? Rent Surge Displaces Residents</h1>

        <p>Finding an apartment is a rite of passage for anyone above a certain age. But in New York, that takes on a meaning all its own. It’s an experience you either find yourself stronger for getting through or demoralized by the end of it.</p>

        <p>And as with all things it has touched, the pandemic exacerbated that fact. Restaurants, bars, and museums, the crowning jewels of the city life were shut down overnight. And in 2020, rent plummeted as the city saw a mass exodus.</p>

        <p>But as New York returns to normal, many who cashed in on what was dubbed “covid prices” are seeing a sharp increase in rent should they choose to renew their lease. Others who were granted a reprieve during the pandemic are now facing the weight of eviction – leaving feelings of shock and desperation in its wake.</p>
        
        <p>And advocates are searching for ways to keep tenants from falling by the wayside as the gleam of a city back on its feet glimmers on the horizon.</p>

        <p>Stephanie Lai, a 22-year-old Columbia student in her final semester, is in the middle of a third rent increase in the past year at her 4-bedroom apartment located on the corner of 125th and Riverside Drive in Harlem.</p>

        <p>In 2020, Lai leased her apartment for $3,600 with three other roommates. “Personally, I was paying under $900 dollars for rent. That was really amazing, I miss those days,” Lai laughs.</p>

        <p>In May, Lai decided to renew the lease the following year, resulting in a $500 rent increase. And then again, and perhaps, for a final time, to $4,800. Lai was not notified of the increase until she looked over her lease with her roommates.</p>

        <p>“The problem that we're having is that we don't really have much room to negotiate with the realtor,” says Lai. “They've been making it very difficult for us to have any bargaining power. They think ‘well, someone will pay for this apartment if you don't.’”</p>

        <p>This trend is not only apparent in Harlem, or even in New York City. People are being priced out of their homes across the country too Kim Johnson a policy analyst at the National Low Income Housing Coalition in Washington, DC said. “Recently, we're seeing skyrocketing rent costs across the country. They're particularly acute in metropolitan areas like New York and D.C., but we see it in rural towns too,” she said.</p>

        <p>The National Low Income Housing Coalition’s entire function is to advance federal policies regarding affordable housing, something Johnson recognizes is not a quick fix, in fact, it’s a longstanding systemic issue. “This was a problem even before the pandemic, that has been made worse by big failures on the part of the federal government to make the needed investments in deeply affordable housing,” Johnson said.</p>

        <p>Issues of housing insecurity and displacement exist beyond the confines of the pandemic as well. And it affects more than “market-rate tenants,” or tenants who are not protected by affordable housing laws. Rent stabilized units tend to be the permanent home to families with strong roots in their respective communities, according to Alejandro Coriat of The Goddard Law Project.</p>

        <p>When the pandemic hit, some market-rate tenants were able to negotiate their rent, but now they are at the mercy of the landlords. “[Market-rate] tenants don't really have much of a leg to stand on beyond the term of the lease,” Coriat said. “Landlords can retaliate against them for demanding repairs, for complaining, or just refuse to renew a lease and essentially push people out.”</p>
            
        <p>Goddard works with such tenants in organizing their own efforts against price hikes, such as withholding rent. But even that has its own challenges. “It’s difficult to organize when you have such uneven groups of tenants, that have different incentives, protections, and needs,” Coriat said. </p>
        
        <p>What’s happening in Harlem is merely a microcosm of the city since the eviction moratorium was lifted nearly 2 months ago. </p>
        
        <p>The number of eviction cases in the courts is far more than the number of available attorneys to represent tenants, leading many housing advocates to worry about the sustainability of the Right to Counsel law, which guarantees low-income residents free legal representation in eviction cases.</p>
           
        <p>The Goddard Law Project along with other housing advocacy organizations point to “good cause” legislation as another layer of protector for tenants. Under this legislation, landlords would have to give specific reasons for eviction and would allow tenants to challenge rent increases over 3 percent.</p>

        <p>These changes are a reprieve for tenants – but for many, the damage has already been done. For Lai, and her roommates, well, “we’re splitting up,” she confirms. One is renewing the lease, the other two intend to move when the lease is up, and Lai herself is moving to Washington, DC after graduation.</p>
        
        <p>And for Lai, and thousands of others, New York City’s return to normal is anything but normal. It’s disruptive, and for residents who feel their struggles are beginning to fall to the wayside – Coriat is cautiously optimistic about the outcome. “There's a cohort of elected officials at the assembly and senate level, there are organizations on the ground doing the leg work who are really passionate about [this cause],” he said. “There's a small chance that it [the legislation protecting tenants] may actually pass.”</p>
